## Initialization

1. Call the initialize function from the TapFramework and pass the **API Key** provided by Brankas.

	```swift

	import DirectTapFramework

	DirectTapSF.shared.initialize(apiKey: "apiKey")

	```

***NOTE:* Before calling any function, it is important to call the *initialize* function first in order to gain access to the *checkout* function. Also, to use the Sandbox environment, set the *isDebug* variable to true**

## Usage

The Framework has a **checkout** function wherein it responds with a redirect url used to launch the Tap web application. An option is given either to use the url manually or let the Framework launch it via Safari Web Browser

In order to use the checkout function, an **DirectTapRequest** is needed to be created and be passed. It has the following details:

1. **sourceAccount** - the account to be used as a sender of money for bank transfer. It consists of **BankCode** (code for a specific bank) and **Country** (country of origin)

***NOTE:*** If **bankCode** is set to **nil**, an internal bank selection screen will be shown inside Tap web application. If it has been filled up, that bank would automatically be selected instead.

2. **destinationAccountId** - the ID of the registered account of the receiver of money for bank transfer. This is provided by Brankas. Each registered account has a corresponding ID.

3. **amount** - the amount of money to be transferred. It consists of **Currency** (the currency of the money to be transferred) and **numInCents** - amount in centavos (e.g. If value to be transferred is PHP 1, the value to be passed in amount should be "100" - value is multiplied by 100).

4. **memo** - the note or description attached to the bank transfer

5. **customer** - pertains to the details of the sender of money. It consists of **firstName**, **lastName**, **email** and **mobileNumber**

6. **referenceId**

7. **client** - pertains to the customizations in the Tap Web Application and callback url once bank transfer is finished. It consists of **displayName** (name in the header to be shown in the Tap Web Application), **logoUrl** (URL of the logo to be shown), **returnUrl** (URL where Tap would be redirecting after bank transfer is finished), **failUrl** (optional URL where Tap would be redirecting if bank transfer has failed), **statementRetrieval** (Bool that shows the list of statements after bank transfer is finished; its default value is false)

8. **browserMode** - **None** (checkout URL will be returned and the developer is given the option to launch Tap Web Application through his own WebView), **Safari** (Tap Web Application is launched through Safari Web Browser) and **WebView** (Tap Web application is launched through the built-in WKWebView from the Framework)<br/><br/>
***NOTE:*** When using the **WebView** BrowserMode, ensure that the ViewController to be passed in the checkout function is attached to a **UINavigationController** so that the Framework can provide a back button.

9. **dismissAlert** - pertains to the showing of alert dialog when closing the WebView. It consists of **message**, **positiveButtonText** and **negativeButtonText**. Just set this value to null to remove the alert dialog when closing the application.

10. **useRememberMe** - pertains to using the remember me feature of the Tap Web Application (default value is true and will not be showing up if set to false)

11. **expiryDate** -  refers to the expiry time of the created invoice

12. **uniqueAmount** -  refers to the enabling of centavo reconciliation workaround logic

Here is a sample on how to use it and call:

```swift

import UIKit
import DirectTapFramework

class ViewController: UIViewController, CoreDelegate {
    typealias T = String
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        // Do any additional setup after loading the view.
        
        TapSF.shared.initialize(apiKey: "hjkozDM1YcaE00q60T2qCj3s4Pb1ui0p3K2V6hjyu5AxR7A8E0IAK5G1u4sRrbcH5", certPath: nil, isDebug: true)
        
        let account = Account(country: Country.PH)
        let amount = Amount(currency: Currency.php, numInCents: "10000")
        let customer = Customer(firstName: "First", lastName: "Last", email: "hello@gmail.com", mobileNumber: "63")
        var client = Client()
        client.displayName = "Display Name"
        client.returnUrl = "www.google.com"
    	
	var request = TapRequest(sourceAccount: account, destinationAccountId: "5887e376-383c-11eb-b400-4hsddb0c633ac", amount: amount, memo: "Bank Transfer", customer: customer, referenceId: "sample-reference", client: client, dismissAlert: DismissAlert(message: "Do you want to close the application?", confirmButtonText: "Yes", cancelButtonText: "Cancel"))
        
        request.browserMode = TapRequest.BrowserMode.WebView
        do {
            try DirectTapSF.shared.checkout(tapRequest: request, vc: self, delegate: self)
        } catch {
            print("Error: \(error)")
        }
    }
    
    func onResult(data: String?, error: String?, errorCode: String?) {
        if let str = data {
            print("TRANSACTION ID: \(str)")
        }
        
        if let err = error {
            print("Error Logs: \(err) - \(errorCode)")
        }
    }
}
```

***NOTE:*** If **browserMode** has been set to **None**, the redirect URL for the Tap Web Application will be returned after checkout has been successful.

After transaction, to detect if it is successful, the web browser will be redirected to a similar URL:
**https://tap.sandbox.bnk.to/www.google.com?transaction_id=f3f53e0c-720d-428e-8c7a-7a95671ae32c&status=2**

The url will be composed of:
* Return url
* Transaction Id
* and status

If the transaction failed, it will be redirected to this URL: **https://tap.sandbox.bnk.to/error**
